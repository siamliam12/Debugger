# Debugger
A web based board game for developers and programmers.

Game Concept: Debugger
Theme: Players take on the role of debuggers, racing to fix bugs in a fictional codebase.

Gameplay:

Board: A game board representing different code modules or functions.
Pieces: Player pieces represent debuggers.
Cards: Bug cards, code improvement cards, and challenge cards.
Dice: Used to determine movement or card draws.
Mechanics:

Setup: Players start at the beginning of the board.

Turns: Players take turns rolling the dice to move their debugger.

Landing on Spaces:

Bug spaces: Draw a bug card. The card describes a bug with varying difficulty levels. Players can attempt to fix the bug by rolling a certain number or playing code improvement cards.
Code improvement spaces: Draw a code improvement card. These cards offer benefits like extra moves, bug prevention, or temporary boosts.
Challenge spaces: Draw a challenge card. These cards present special challenges or mini-games related to programming concepts.
Fixing Bugs: Players can attempt to fix bugs by rolling the dice or using code improvement cards. Successful bug fixes earn points.

Winning: The first player to reach the end of the board with the highest score wins.

Additional Ideas:

Different Bug Types: Introduce various bug types (syntax errors, logic errors, runtime errors) with different effects.
Code Optimization: Implement a mechanic where players can optimize code for bonus points.
Teamwork: Allow players to collaborate on fixing complex bugs.
Random Events: Include cards that introduce unexpected events like "server crash" or "new feature request".
